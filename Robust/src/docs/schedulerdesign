Basic design of scheduler:

activetask: Queue of active tasks
failedtasks: Hashtable of failed task/parameter combinations
objectqueues: For each class we have a list of parameterwrapper objects

1. ObjectQueues

Each parameterwrapper object is a set of objects that can serve as a
specific parameter for a specific task.  This set is stored in the
hashtable referenced by the objectset field.  A reference to the
relevant taskdescriptor is stored in the task field.

Each parameterwrapper object has an array of ints: intarray This array
contains numberofterms pairs of integere: i*2 and i*2+1. The first
integer in a pair contains an "and" mask of the flags that the task
cares about.  The second integer in the pair contains the flag
settings.  If the flag of an object matches any of these masks, then
the object should be placed in the object set.

1.1 Objectsets

Each objectset is implemented using a hashtable.  If an object is in
the objectset, the objectset hashtable maps that object to either NULL
or the next objectset the object is a member of.

1.2

Each object with a flag contains a flagptr field ((struct RuntimeHash
*) ptr)[2].  This field points to the first objectset hashtable that
the object is a member of.
