Example:
task test(Baz a {}{tag Foo x}, Bar b {}{tag Foo x, Tag Far y}) {
}

Idea: Each parameter with a tag has its own queue and a hashtable that
is indexed by the tag

When adding the object to the queue, the runtime: 

1) cycles through each tag of the appropriate type in that object and
index into the other queues for that tag

2) if multiple objects have that tag, have to search each possible
one...

3) if the parameter is specified to have a second tag, search through
each possible second tag

Each flag object has tag pointer - it can either point to a tag object
or a list of tags...
