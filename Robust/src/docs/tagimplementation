Baz a {}{Tag Foo x}, Bar b {}{Tag Foo x, Tag Far y}


Idea: Each parameter has its own queue and a hashtable that is indexed by 
the tag

When adding the object to the queue, the system:
cycles through each tag of the appropriate type in that object and indexes 
into the other queues for that tag...if multiple objects have that tag, 
have to search each possible one...if the parameter is specified to have a 
second tag, search through each possible second tag

Each flag object has tag pointer - it can either point to a tag object or 
a list of tags...
