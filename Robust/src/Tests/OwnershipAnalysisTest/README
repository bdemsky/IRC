test01
	This test program contains many tasks that
individually illustrate the correctness of different
ownership analysis elements.  The program source code
includes comments that describe what the final ownership
graphs for each task should be.  These are sort of like
unit tests for the individual operations performed during
ownership analysis.

test02
	This test program contains many tasks that are
named to indicate whether they purposefully create aliases
or not.  This test comes from the top-down approach to see
that the individual operations of the ownership analysis
work together to produce the correct results.

testGraph
	This test program puts some ownership graph
objects and some supporting data in a vacuum to test
the critical merge() and equals() members.
