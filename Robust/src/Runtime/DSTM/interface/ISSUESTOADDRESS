High priority list
-------------------------------------
0) Fix objstr issues...
  A) allocations always have to traverse to end of list
  B) do we need to zero first?? -- need to check about this one, it may be okay

1) Wrap all receive calls in loops
  A) Perhaps the best way is to just define a macro or function call that
does this. Look at GETSIZE macro for example...

2) Check locking... There is likely a race condition on getObjType().  

3) Receiving object code assume a maximum object size.  It is probably
better to:
  A) read size in.
  B) allocate space for object at its final destination
  C) read into the space

Low priority list
---------------------------------

1) We shouldn't call memcopy for copying fixed-sized structs or primitive
values...just use =
