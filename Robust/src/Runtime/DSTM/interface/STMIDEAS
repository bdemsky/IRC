TODO List/Ideas for Software Transactional Memory Project:

1) Do reads/writes to new objects in place

2) Compute types of objects that are only read by a transaction. Do
reads of these objects in place.

3) Don't lock object on TransRead

4) Immutable object optimizations...For immutable objects such as
Strings/Integers/Doubles/Float objects, don't even copy, just elide
TRANSREAD call.
