TODO List/Ideas for Software Transactional Memory Project:

1) Do reads/writes to new objects in place

2) Compute types of objects that are only read by a transaction. Do
reads of these objects in place.

3) Don't lock object on TransRead

4) Immutable object optimizations...For immutable objects such as
Strings/Integers/Doubles/Float objects, don't even copy, just elide
TRANSREAD call.

5) Eliminate read locks in the transaction commit process.  The idea
is to first acquire all the write locks, then go through the read
array.  For each object in the read array we check: (1) that the
version numbers match and (2) that it hasn't been write locked.  The
serialization point for a transaction is when all write locks have
been acquired but before any reads have been checked.
