Big TODOS:
1) Handle rapid reuse of SESEStall record - done
2) Handle linked list of bins - done
3) Hashtable management (managing links + each SESE should have its own traverser threads + traversers should be generated on demand)
4) Multiple taint of coarse management [what if one coarse entry supports two parameter conflicts...] -- fixed
5) Recycling [recycle entries to improve runtime]
6) Parallelize traversal
7) Fix race on enqueue into table vs dequeue at retire... - done
