Why doesn't the example work written like this?

In makeNewTree when 
TreeNode left = buildSubTree( ...

The variable edge from left has reachability states
saying it can get to an object reachable from previous
root objects, which seems obviously over conservative, then

root.left = left;

seals the deal and updates the graph by introducing states that admit
reachability from both the newest root and a previous root.


Why did that happen?
