SingleObjectMod.java:
----------------------
 Completes two transactions on single object type inside one loop iteration. The first transaction reads from the 
 object while the second transaction randomly generates an index and writes into the object.
 
 The contention is controlled by decreasing and increasing the size of the shared object array. Also
 we get high contention by increasing the number of loop iterations to regulate the number of 
 transactions that will commit.

 Compiling and Running
 ----------------------

  To build: 
  make stmlock
  e.g. ~/research/Robust/src/Benchmarks/SingleTM/MicroBenchmarks$ make clean && make stmlock

  To run:
  ./STATSSingleObjectMod.bin -t <num threads>
                             -size <array size>
                             -l <loopsize>
                             -l1 <loopsize1>
                             -l2 <loopsize2>
  
  low contention:  -t 8 -size 5000 -l 100
  high contention: -t 8 -size 5 -l 500000
